# MetricFlowClustering
my CAD &amp;&amp; CG 2014 short paper code

This is metric-based clustering for both streamlines and particle trajectories.

We propose several linear-complexity metric enabling an efficient and scalable feature extraction and curve clustering for large-scale fluid simulation data.
